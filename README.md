Hello friends,
In this repository, I collect my work done in Gradient Descent

#
1) In gradient-descent-line-behavior-w-r-t-bias-b.ipynb, you can find 
-- how a graph or line behaves concerning bias
-- a basic and sufficient theory about gradient descent

2) In gradient-descent-line-behavior-w-r-t-slop-m.ipynb, you can find How graphs or lines behave concerning weights

3) In gradient-descent-in-2d.ipynb you can find the actual Gradient Descent code which is the combination of 1) and 2)

Advice: I suggest you follow 1 after 2 after 3 notebooks for clear and better understanding

As you know Gradient Descent has 3 types:-
1. Batch Gradient Descent
notebook:- gradient-descent-n-dimension-general.ipynb
Note:- Batch_Gradient_Descent_Short_Note. pdf
   
3. Stochastic Gradient Descent
notebook(class code):- stochastic-gradient-descent.ipynb
notebook(sci-kit learn applied):- stochastic-gradient-descent-sci-kit-learn.ipynb
Note:- Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_Short_Note. pdf

5. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
notebook(class code):- mini-batch-gradient-descent.ipynb
notebook(sci-kit learn applied):- mini-batch-gradient-descent-sci-kit-learn.ipynb

Learning Schedule (A variable value of learning rate):- "Learning rate keep changing instead of fixed"
notebook:- learning-schedule-variable-learning-rate-gd
