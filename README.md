Hello friends,
In this repository, I collect my work done in Gradient Descent

1. In gradient-descent-line-behavior-w-r-t-bias-b.ipynb, you can find 
1) how a graph or line behaves concerning bias
2) basic and sufficient theory about gradient descent

2. In gradient-descent-line-behavior-w-r-t-slop-m.ipynb, you can find How graphs or lines behave concerning weights

3. In gradient-descent-in-2d.ipynb you can find the actual Gradient Descent code which is the combination of 1. and 2.

Advice: I suggest you follow 1 after 2 after 3 notebooks for clear and better understanding

As you know Gradient Descent has 3 types:-
1. Batch Gradient Descent
notebook:- gradient-descent-n-dimension-general.ipynb
   
3. Stochastic Gradient Descent
notebook:- stochastic-gradient-descent.ipynb

5. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent

Note:- This repository is under heavy development so stay connected.
