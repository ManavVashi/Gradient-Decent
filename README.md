# Gradient-Decent-By-The-AI 

#
1) Notebook: gradient-descent-line-behavior-w-r-t-bias-b.ipynb
   * Content: how lines behave when we make changes in bias/content

2) Notebook: gradient-descent-line-behavior-w-r-t-slop-m.ipynb
   * Content: How lines behave when we make changes in weights/coefficients

3) Notebook: gradient-descent-in-2d.ipynb
   * Content: Gradient Descent class code
   * when we combine 1) and 2) then it become code of gradient descent

Advice: I suggest you follow 1 after 2 after 3 notebooks for clear and better understanding

#
As you know Gradient Descent has 3 types:-
1. Batch Gradient Descent
  * Notebook:- gradient-descent-n-dimension-general.ipynb
  * Notes:- Batch_Gradient_Descent_Short_Note. pdf
   
2. Stochastic Gradient Descent

  * Notebook(class code):- stochastic-gradient-descent.ipynb
  * Notebook(sci-kit learn applied):- stochastic-gradient-descent-sci-kit-learn.ipynb
  * Notes:- Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_Short_Note. pdf

4. Mini-Batch Gradient Descent
  * Notebook(class code):- mini-batch-gradient-descent.ipynb
  * Notebook(sci-kit learn applied):- mini-batch-gradient-descent-sci-kit-learn.ipynb

#
* Learning Schedule (A variable value of learning rate):- "Learning rate keeps changing in every epoch instead of being constant"
  * notebook:- learning-schedule-variable-learning-rate-gd
