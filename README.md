Hello friends,
In this repository I collect my work done in gradient decent

1. In gradient-descent-line-behavior-w-r-t-bias-b.ipynb, you can find 
1) how graph or line behave with respect to bias
2) basic and sufficient theory about gradient decent

2. In gradient-descent-line-behavior-w-r-t-slop-m.ipynb, you can find How graph or line behave with respect to weights

3. In gradient-descent-in-2d.ipynb you can find actual Gradient Descent code which is the combination of 1. and 2.

Advice: I suggest you to follow 1 after 2 after 3 notebook for clear and better understanding

Note:- This repository is under heavy development so stay connected.
